## Adding a Header and Images

![Adding header](http://cl.ly/WFBz/03-header.png)

In this checkpoint we'll add images to the Jottly landing page and create a new HTML header.

### Adding images

Download [this set of images](http://cl.ly/WFEA/Jottly-Images.zip). Extract the ZIP file and move the images inside the downloaded folder into the Jottly images folder.

You should have the following files in `Jottly/images`:

* `action.jpg`
* `app.png`
* `avatar1.jpg`
* `avatar2.jpg`
* `avatar3.jpg`
* `header.jpg`
* `logo.png`
* `small_logo.png`

> We'll add these images to the landing page as we update the HTML and CSS.

### Updating the HTML with new header content

We'll add the first section - the header - to our landing page using a `div` tag. A `div`, or division, is an HTML element used to define content or a group of elements for styling and positioning.

```html(index.html)
<body>
-
- <h1>Hello world!</h1>
-
+  <!-- Header
+  ================================================== -->
+  <div id="header">
+  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Within this `div` tag, we've added the attribute `id`, which identifies a single element on a page. When naming elements, you can choose to give them an `id` or `class`. As we learn more about CSS, we'll discuss the differences between classes and ids.

We've given our `div` an `id` named `header`, which we'll use for styling the header content.

> When you open a tag, such as `<div>`, it's important to remember to immediately close it using a forward slash, like `</div>`, so you don't end up with unclosed tags.

Let's add an image to our header:

```html(index.html)
<div id="header">
+  <img src="images/logo.png" />
</div>
```

We use an `img` tag to include the `logo.png` file we downloaded earlier. The `img` must be sourced (`src`) to where it resides in our directory structure. In this case, the logo is named `logo.png`, and is inside the `images` folder. Since our `index.html` file is on the top level of our directory, we first must point to the folder where the content is located, and then the file name. If an image fails to render, it's often because the source path isn't properly defined.

> `img` tags don't require separate closing tags. They can be closed by adding a forward slash right before the last `>`, as we do above.

Next, we'll add placeholder navigation links. These links won't be connected to any additional pages, but it's helpful to include them proactively for the holistic design. In this case, we're adding two: "Sign In" and "Sign Up Now":

```html(index.html)
<div id="header">
  <img src="images/logo.png" />
+  <nav>
+    <ul>
+      <li><a href="#">Sign In</a></li>
+      <li><a href="#">Sign Up Now</a></li>
+    </ul>
+  </nav>
</div>
```

We started with a `nav` tag, which defines a group of navigation links. Inside the `nav` tag, we include an unordered list (`ul`). These help build simple lists, and are often used to define navigation links. Nested inside the `ul`, we have two `li`, or list items. Within these elements, the text is wrapped with an anchor tag, or `a`, which defines a link to another section of content, page or external link. The destination of the link is determined by the `href="#"`.

> We are using the hashtag (`#`) for our anchor tags because we don't currently have pages to link to. If you wanted to link to another page, you would replace the hashtag with the name of the file, for example, `href="about.html"`.

Now, let's add a headline and some paragraph text to explain what Jottly is all about:

```html(index.html)
<div id="header">
  <img src="images/logo.png" />
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Sign In</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Sign Up Now</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
+  <h1>An easier way to write &amp; collaborate</h1>
+  <p>Put down the pen and paper. Jott.ly helps you organize your <strong>life, home and office</strong>. It's a simple way to store and share ideas with your loved ones, friends and colleagues.</p>
</div>
```

Headers come in six default size â€” `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc. The `h1` tag should **always** be used as your primary headline on the page, not only for sizing purposes, but also for better SEO (or Search Engine Optimization).

Using the paragraph (`p`) tag, we can explain what Jottly is and does. We've selected a portion of this text to **bold** using the `strong` tag. If you wanted some text to appear as italics, you could wrap that text in the `em` tag.

Next, we'll add a simple text input field along with a submit button. Eventually, these elements could be used for gathering email addresses:

```html(index.html)
<div id="header">
  <img src="images/logo.png" />
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Sign In</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Sign Up Now</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <h1>An easier way to write &amp; collaborate</h1>
    <p>Put down the pen and paper. Jott.ly helps you organize your <strong>life, home and office</strong>. It's a simple way to store and share ideas with your loved ones, friends and colleagues.</p>
+    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your email address"/>
+    <button type="submit">Sign Up Now</button>
</div>
```

We defined our `input` with a type of `text` so a user can enter their email address. There are a number of [input types](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp) that could be used. We could also change this field type to `email`. The attribute `placeholder` allows you to define the text that appears inside the field before a user enters their information. This can provide some helpful context for the user.

> Inputs are another tag in HTML that don't need a closing `</>` tag, like image tags.

We also added a button to allow the user to sign up. We use the `button` tag, and again, define the type, but this time using `submit`. Wrapped in the tag, we include the text that will appear on the button.

### Pushing your changes

Push your changes to Github:

```bash(Terminal)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added header content and images"
$ git push origin gh-pages
```

We that we have the content set up for our header, we'll continue moving down the page, adding and styling each section to produce our final product.
