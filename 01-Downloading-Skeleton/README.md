## Downloading Skeleton

![Download Skeleton](http://cl.ly/WEym/01-skeleton.png)

In this checkpoint, we're going to download a simple HTML and CSS framework called [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/). We'll use this markup to develop the landing page for Jott.ly.
	
### Setting up
You can easily download the source code by clicking on `Download` in the left-hand navigation. It will direct you to a button to `Download Skeleton 1.2 from Github`. The files come in ZIP file that you will then extract. You will want to rename the folder `Jottly` and keep it in an easy to find location on your machine. Within that folder, you will see the file structure for Skeleton, which includes the following:

**index.html**

**stylesheets (folder)**

* base.css
* skeleton.css
* layout.css

**images (folder):**

* favicon.ico
* apple-touch-icon (x3)


### Github
