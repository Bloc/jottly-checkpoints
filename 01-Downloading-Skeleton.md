## Installing Skeleton

> Skeleton 2.0 was recently published, and this tutorial is being updated based on those changes.

In this checkpoint we'll install a simple HTML and CSS framework named [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and use it to develop the landing page for Jottly. CSS frameworks solve many common problems that occur in most web pages. For example, rather than coding your own CSS grid layout - which nearly every web site needs - a framework like Skeleton takes care of this for you, and allows you to use its code to customize further or use as-is. We'll use some default Skeleton code for Jottly, but we'll also update some of it, to make Jottly even more unique.

> Think of a framework like a [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/) restaurant. Chipotle provides a framework for standard burritos with things that most people want - like rice, beans and meat. But you can customize your burrito to add things that only you may want - like hot salsa and guacamole.

### Install Skeleton

![Downloading Skeleton](https://bloc-books.s3.amazonaws.com/jottly/download-skeleton.gif)

Download the source code by clicking on the **Download** link in the left-hand navigation of the Skeleton site. Click the button labeled **Download Skeleton 1.2 from Github**. Find the downloaded file named **dhg-Skeleton-7ab6820.tar.gz** and double-click to extract it. Rename the folder to **Jottly** and move it to an easy-to-find location on your machine.

> We suggest creating a "code" or "projects" directory to keep projects like Jottly

Within the **Jottly** folder, you will see the directory structure for Skeleton, which includes the following:

* `index.html`: This is the main HTML page we will edit.
* `/stylesheets`: This directory holds all of our CSS files.
* `/stylesheets/base.css`: This file contains all of the basic styles for the Skeleton template.
* `/stylesheets/skeleton.css`: This file is the grid that we'll be using.
* `/stylesheets/layout.css`: This doesn't contain any specific styles yet, but will be used for media queries which allow the site to be designed responsively.
* `/images`: This directory holds the images that will be displayed on the site.

### Viewing Locally

As you go through each checkpoint of this book, you will want to view your work as you update it. First, open up your browser â€” we suggest Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/). Next, open up the index.html file from your folder. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting open, or by double-clicking on the file.

> We recommend keeping index.html open in your browser as you update the files. You will need to refresh your browser to view changes.

In the next checkpoint, we'll delete the default content.
